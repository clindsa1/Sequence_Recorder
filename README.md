# Sequence_Recorder
record timed sequences of characters received over the serial port

The idea is to use this as a wrapper around something that creates physical events like lights or noises.

## Mode
The recorder has 3 modes
1) live keyboard
2) playback
3) recorder

## Use F1 through F8 keys
files are named "one" through "eight"
pressing the same F# key stops the recording
